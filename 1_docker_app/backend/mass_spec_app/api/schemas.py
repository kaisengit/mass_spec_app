"""
Defines Pydantic schemas for data validation and serialization of request/response payloads.
Schemas are used for ensuring valid input when interacting with compounds, measured-compounds, retention times, and adducts.
They are split into three partsâ€”Base (common to all), Create (POST), and Response (GET, which includes auto-generated fields).
